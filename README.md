# Python-ML-AI
This repository features Python-based Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects


## Image Classification Model: 
A model for classifying images using OpenCV for face and eye detection, wavelet transforms for feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for classification.

## Content Generator:
This repo includes a content_generator function that uses a language model endpoint from Hugging Face to generate responses based on user queries. The function leverages few-shot learning with example-based prompting to enhance response accuracy.


The project includes a fully functional Django frontend, allowing seamless interaction with the models via a user-friendly web interface. Ideal for ML enthusiasts and developers looking to explore AI-powered content generation and image classification in real-world applications.
